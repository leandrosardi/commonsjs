# CommonsJs

The **commonsJs** is a little library of functions used at [**ExpandedVenture**](https://expandedventure.com/expandedventure) to develop different UI/UX features.

The **commonsJs** library is just starting on Nov-2020, and more functions will be added as needed.

The **commonsJs** library has been written following the [**W3C JavaScript Best Practices**](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/JavaScript_best_practices).

* [**TempaltesJs**](https://github.com/leandrosardi/templatesjs).
